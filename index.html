        <h2>My name Is Himansh Ahuja. This year is very special for people who wished that this year the pandemic which is covid-19 gets finished and all people will have freedom to move accross the world.
            Due to covid-19 all students had to study or do classes online which led to the increment in the use of electronic devices. During the lockdown I learned and achieved new skills like cooking, skating at home, etc. By referencing youtube I was able to cook for the first time.
            I want to take many resolutions this year just because this year will clean the virus. People have high hopes for this year to release vaccine for covid-19.</h2>
